# Prime Solo Projects
Prime Solo Projects is a way for Prime students to share each others' projects. Students can search projects by name, cohort, description or program, can view a screenshot of each completed project and click links to view the github repo and the app hosted on the web. Students can upload their projects and have a chance to review their inputs and edit before their final project is uploaded.
